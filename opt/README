Variety of tools and packages

These tools are not added automatically to "%PATH%". To enable the tool,
declare the path to the tool in "shellenv.cfg".

If you want to maintain different versions of one tool you can follow
the procedure as below:

1. store each version of the tool in a separate directory

2.1. create a junction link using the command

    mklink /j NAME NAME-VERSION

2.2. create a directory symbolic link using the command

    mklink /d NAME NAME-VERSION
