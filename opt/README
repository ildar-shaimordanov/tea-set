Variety of tools and packages

If you want to maintain different versions of one tool you can follow the procedure as below:

1. store each version of the tool in a separate directory
2.1. create a junction link using the command "mklink /j NAME NAME-VERSION"
2.2. create a directory symbolic link using the command "mklink /d NAME NAME-VERSION"
