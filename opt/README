Variety of tools and packages

If you want to maintain different versions of one tool you can follow the procedure as below:

1. store each version of the tool as a separate directory under the "000versions" directory
2. create a directory symbolic link using the command "mklink /d NAME 000versions\NAME-VERSION"
