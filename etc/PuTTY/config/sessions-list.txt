# Usually host lists are documented and distributed as the lists of
# entries where the first item is the host name and the second one is its
# IP address. Sometimes they can be the simple lists of host names only.
#
# This file contains the mappings of session names (how they are supposed
# to be stored in PuTTY) and host names (PuTTY connects to). If the host
# name is not presented the session name is used.
#
# Examples:
#
#	localhost		127.0.0.1
#	example.com
#	x.acme.com		1.2.3.4
#	y.acme.com		1.2.3.5
