Default settings for the portable version of PuTTY by Jacub Kotrla:
https://jakub.kotrla.net/putty/

Copy the content of this directory into the place on your computer where
you have deployed PuTTY.

The "#default-settings.session" file contains all PuTTY settings with some
changes I found in my practice useful and convenient (see them below). You
can modify this file as you want. The better way is to run PuTTY, load the
session, change parameters and save again. Further these settings are
spreaded on other sessions by executing the "create-putty-sessions.bat"
script.

The script reads the "putty.conf" configuration file to retreive the
directory configured to store PuTTY sessions and the extension for
sessions filenames. The list of hosts or sessions is read from the
"sessions-list.txt" file.

Both files "create-putty-sessions.bat" and "sessions-list.txt" MUST be
placed in the same directory, next each other.
